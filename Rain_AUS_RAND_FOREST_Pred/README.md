# Weather Prediction Using Decision Trees and Random Forests


This project was one of my first ml projects. It was a combination of many different things I had learned. It predicts weather conditions using decision tree and random forest classifiers. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains various weather-related features. As you can see from all the comments throughout the script, I tried multiple different strategies. In the end, thje random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy of 85.57% validation amd 98.15% train
