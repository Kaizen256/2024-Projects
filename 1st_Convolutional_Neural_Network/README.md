This is the first pytorch CNN I made. It uses the FashionMNIST dataset. The first block of the model contains two convolutional 2d layers, which have rectified linear units (ReLU) after each of them. The block ends with a max pooling layer. The second block, the Sequential block is the same as the first block but it reuses hidden_units for in_channels and out_channels. The third block (classifier block) flattens the output from the convolutional layers into a 1D tensor and then the linear layer makes it match the number of classes. I used 10 hidden units for this.
