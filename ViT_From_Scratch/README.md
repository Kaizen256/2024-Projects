# ViT from scratch


For this project I coded a ViT from a research paper with help from a book. I analyzed the research paper and applied everything mentioned, such as a Multihead Self Attention Block, a Transformer Encoder Block, and Patch Embedding. This was really fun to code. I had a lot of fun writing it and it taught me a lot. I did not write the helper functions. This ViT was used on a pizza steak and sushi dataset I recieved from the book as well.


Summarizing all the layers would be pointless for me to even attempt to explain. If you wish to see, model.py contains all of my code.
