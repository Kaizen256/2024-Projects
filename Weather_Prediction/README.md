# Weather Prediction Using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project was one of my first ML projects. It was a combination of many different things I had learned. It predicts weather conditions using decision trees and random forest classifiers. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains various weather-related features. As you can see from all the comments throughout the script, I tried multiple different strategies. In the end, the random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy. 85.57% validation and 98.15% train
