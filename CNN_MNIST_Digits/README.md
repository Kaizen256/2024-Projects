# MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The model is trained to classify handwritten digits (0-9).

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional blocks and a fully connected layer for classification. Each convolutional block consists of convolutional layers, ReLU activations, and max pooling. The training step involves forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and weight updates using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The code includes functionality to save and load model checkpoints to resume training or for evaluation purposes. Trained on 30 epochs.
