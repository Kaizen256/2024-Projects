# Moon Classification

This simple project demonstrates how to create and classify a moon-shaped dataset using a simple neural network in PyTorch. The model is trained to classify data points into two different classes.

Synthetic moon-shaped dataset generated using make_moons from sklearn.datasets. Simple neural network with three linear layers and Tanh activations.

Input Layer: 2 features.
Hidden Layers: Two hidden layers with 16 units each and Tanh activations.
Output Layer: Single output unit for binary classification.
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits Loss (BCEWithLogitsLoss).
Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Epochs: 1000
Accuracy: 100%
